## Purpose 

The goal of this package is to provide a centralized place to clearly visualize the effects of climate change based on key demographics by country. `mpm` is a package that contains data about various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by country based on GDP and population.

## Target audience

This package would find excellent use by governmental agencies to determine how their GHG emissions are affecting their communities. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of mpm like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("parunjodhi/mpm")
```

## Plan for Phase III

In Phase III, we plan to expand this package to include a function that has the ability to plot how GHG emissions affect health issues (asthma, chronic diseases, air quality) in a given community based on the variables we have currently included.
