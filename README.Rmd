The goal of this package is to provide a centralized place to clearly visualize the effects of climate change based on key demographics by country. `mpm` is a package that contains data about various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution metrics in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and internal displacement per country based on GDP and population.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mpm` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("parunjodhi/mpm")
```

Load `mpm` R package
```{r}
library(mpm)
```

## Datasets Included
  + `owid_ghg`: A dataset looking at CO2 and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions filtered for countries in North America.
  + `air_data`: A dataset looking at air pollution in terms of DALYS filtered for countries in North America.
  + `regional_grouping`: A dataset grouping North American countries into regions by economic class
  + `displaced_by_disaster`: A dataset looking at internal displacement counts due to extreme events caused by climate change.
  
### Example: Air Pollution Data Measured in DALYS
```{r}
head(air_data)
```

## Functions Included
  + `population_plot`: Graphs population of a country over the years.
  + `gdp_plot`: Graphs GDP of a country over the years.
  + `ghg_plot`: Graphs GHG of a country over the years.
  + `all_demographics`: Graphs separately population, GDP and GHG of a country over the years.
  + `population_predict`: Predict the population for a country for a specific year.
  + `gdp_predict`: Predict the GDP for a country for a specific year.
  + `ghg_predict`: Predict the total GHG for a country for a specific year.
  + `all_data_country`: Gather data from all data sets for a country.
  + `dalys_predict`: Predict DALYS and total GHG for a country for a specific year.
  + `displaced_areachart`: Area Chart of internal displacement comparing the U.S with a specific country.
  + `displaced_histogram`: Distribution of people internally displaced in a country.
  + `displaced_linegraph`: Graph of internal displacement counts over the years for a specific country.
  
## Basic Usage
These are a few examples of how to use the package and its functions to wrangle and visualize data related to demographics and emissions in countries in North America.

### Data Visualization functions
  1. Visualize the trend in internal displacement for Mexico and the U.S.
```{r}
displaced_areachart("Mexico")
```

  2. Visualize the trends in population, GDP and total GHG emissions for Jamaica from 2000 to 2020
```{r}
all_demographics("Jamaica", min_year = 2000)
```

### Prediction functions
  1. If all else stays constant, what would be the total DALYs and GHG emissions for the United States in 2030?
```{r}
dalys_predict(2045)
```

  2. If all else stays constant, what would be the GDP for Mexico in 2045?
```{r}
gdp_predict(2045, "Mexico")
```
