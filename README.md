## Purpose

The goal of this package is to provide a centralized place to clearly
visualize the effects of climate change based on key demographics by
country. `mpm` is a package that contains data about various greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by country based on GDP and population.

## Target audience

This package would find excellent use by governmental agencies to
determine how their GHG emissions are affecting their community.

## Plan for Phase III

In Phase III, we plan to expand this package to have the ability to plot
how those GHG emissions affect health issues (asthma, chronic diseases,
air quality) based on the existing variables.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mpm like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("parunjodhi/mpm")
```
